/* 
 * Hacky, yes, but you chain your single class CSS selectors
 * to give higher specificity (just twice does the trick, but could do
 * 11 times so it has higher specificity than an id)
 */
  
/* Also, you can't break the chaining across lines the way you tried
   (with a newline, then next line starting with a dot) */

/* all:inherit causes some text color to not change, and links not to
   take on their color */

/* remove pseudo elements */

/* Couldn't do this with Javascript */

/* 
 * since you're chaining, the pseudo element (::after) goes at the
 * very end of the selector.
 * (yes: .classname.classname::after ,
 *   no: .classname::after.classname::after)
